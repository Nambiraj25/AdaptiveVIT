# AdaViT: Adaptive Vision Transformers for Multi-Domain Image Recognition

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the paper **"AdaViT: Adaptive Vision Transformers for Efficient Image Recognition."** The work presents an adaptive approach to Vision Transformers, enabling them to perform robust image recognition across various domains. The method primarily focuses on dynamically adapting the model architecture and fine-tuning pre-trained models for improved performance on multi-domain tasks.

## Paper Summary
In simple terms, the paper proposes:
- **Adaptive Mechanisms:** The introduction of adaptive techniques that dynamically select and process tokens, which are crucial for handling domain-specific features.
- **Multi-Domain Image Recognition:** A strategy to effectively fine-tune pre-trained Vision Transformer models to achieve better generalization across diverse image domains.
- **Performance Improvements:** Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches on several domain-specific image recognition benchmarks.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **README.md:** This file containing the project overview, installation and usage instructions, results, and observations.
- **data/**: Contains dataset links or instructions on how to acquire the datasets used for training and evaluation.
